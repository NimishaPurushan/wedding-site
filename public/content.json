  "storyContent": "He was a quiet boy from Kathmandu who had come to Bangalore to study and build a future. She was a fun-loving girl from Kochi, full of life, who moved to Bangalore for work. Their paths crossed at the office and that’s where everything began to change. At first, she thought he was arrogant, the kind of person who ignored her on purpose. But beneath that quiet exterior was someone thoughtful, kind, and a little shy.\n\n Slowly, they became friends. They started talking, laughing, sharing their dreams and hopes one late conversation at a time. Then the pandemic struck, and life turned upside down. The isolation of living in a Bangalore PG wore her down, and she decided to move back home to Kochi. It was during her final week in the city that he finally made a move and told her how he felt. She had always liked him too, but cultural differences and the fear of how their families would react held her back. Still, when she learned his feelings were real, she decided to take a leap of faith to give their story a chance.\n\nWhat followed was 1.5 years of long-distance love. He visited her in Kochi twice, and they stayed connected through phone calls, texts, and video chats - keeping each other close across the miles. Together, they made a bold decision: to chase their dreams and move abroad for higher studies.\n\nThey came to Canada. Life as international students was tougher than they imagined - long hours, tight budgets, and the pressure of building a future in a new country. But they held on to each other, becoming each other's anchor through every high and low. They completed their master’s degrees and both landed jobs as software developers.\n\nEventually, they opened up to their families about their relationship. It wasn’t easy - there were moments of doubt, disagreements, and disapproval. But love, patience, and time softened hearts. And slowly, both families came around.\n\nNow, after five years of love, laughter, distance, dreams, and togetherness, they are ready to begin a beautiful new chapter as husband and wife.",
